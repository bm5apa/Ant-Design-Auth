This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

<!-- # AntAuth

A modern authentication system built with **React**, **Ant Design**, and a **fake backend** (Next.js API routes). This project demonstrates a login and signup system with features like password strength checking, dark mode, and mock password recovery.

## Features

- ðŸ“± Responsive design with Ant Design ï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Š
- ðŸŒ™ Dark mode toggle ï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Š
- ðŸ”’ Login and signup with form validation ï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Š
- ðŸ“Š Password strength indicator ï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Š
- ðŸ”‘ Mock password recovery (simulated due to fake backend) ï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Šï¼Š

## Limitations

- Uses a fake backend (static `users` array) for demonstration.
- Features like password-recovery and 2FA are simulated (e.g., codes displayed in UI) due to the absence of email/SMS services.
- Social login is not implemented, as it requires third-party OAuth providers.

## Future Enhancements

With a real backend (e.g., Firebase, Node.js), I would:

- Implement email verification and password recovery using Nodemailer.
- Add social login with Google/Facebook OAuth.
- Enable 2FA with SMS or authenticator apps. -->
